                                        <p class="medium-400">Dogs become seniors a lot younger than we may think. A
                                            year for a dog is many-many years of a human life. You may have an early
                                            senior 6- to 7-year-old or a geriatric 15 year old. A long time before dogs
                                            show signs of aging, they have already started aging. Our Senior dogs face
                                            unique challenges as they become prone to age-related diseases (kidney
                                            disease, heart disease, dental disease) in addition to regular disease that
                                            all dogs are prone to. So, if we are able to identify signs of disease
                                            early, we can intervene early. Changes in appetite is one of the common ways
                                            dogs may communicate that something is wrong - not finishing meals,
                                            intermittent or fluctuating eating patterns. Letâ€™s examine what disease
                                            could affect our senior dogs.</p>

                                        <p class="medium-400">Chronic pain can affect most senior dogs at some point and
                                            unfortunately this may be missed as they do not communicate pain like we
                                            humans do. Dental pain may be one of the causes. The dog may eat slow or may
                                            look at food for a while before eating, may have bad breath of you may see
                                            blood on the gums. Yearly professional dental clean under anesthesia by vets
                                            is recommended to monitor dental health. The need for professional cleans
                                            could be reduced by daily brushing and including chewing activities as a way
                                            to reduce plaque buildup.</p>
                                        <p class="medium-400">80% of dogs develop joint pain which may be caused due to
                                            the wear and tear of the musculoskeletal system of dogs. Dogs may show
                                            lethargy, appear depressed, lose appetite, or you may notice lumps and bumps
                                            as you feel them. These are signs that they may be in discomfort. Journaling
                                            these changes and taking them to the vet is what you can do to help them.
                                            You may want to consider senior proofing your home environment for your dog
                                            to prevent further injuries such as ligament strains from slipping, losing
                                            balance on stairs etc. You could consider nonslip cushioned mats on floor
                                            for somewhere for your dog to go to.</p>
                                        <p class="medium-400">Keeping dogs lean can help dogs live healthier and age
                                            better. A good guide for healthy weight is that you canâ€™t see your dogâ€™s
                                            ribs from looking at them but you are able to feel them easily. If your dog
                                            is overweight, you may need a weight reduction program which may include a
                                            vet recommended diet.</p>

                                            recent times, it is now possible to have a screening blood test for common
                                            cancer in dogs. It is called NuQ and available in Australia. The dog need to
                                            fast 8-12 hours for the test, requires 5mls of blood, takes 3-5 days for
                                            testing and could cost $300-500. This is recommended for larger dog breeds
                                            from middle age to older age that are susceptible to cancer. You could
                                            enquire about this test at your veterinary clinic next time, but as it is
                                            very recent development, not everyone may be aware of it.</p>

                                            could be due to age-related loss of hearing, ear infections, ear
                                            medications, due to tumors or due to extended exposure to loud noise. The
                                            ability to hear higher pitched sounds is lost before losing low pitched
                                            sounds. So maybe they may not respond to the whistle as well as they used
                                            to. Often times, this will come as a surprise to the pet parents, but the
                                            hearing loss has been happening for a while, but dogs may compensate for it
                                            for some time. Always bring the pet into vet if you start to notice hearing
                                            loss so they are able to view the ear canals, test different frequency
                                            sounds, test for infections that may be treatable.</p>
                                        <p class="medium-400">To help dogs with hearing loss there are things you could
                                            do to help dogs adjust to the hearing loss that may bring on anxiety, or
                                            they may startle by sudden touch or loud noises. Providing them with a
                                            positive safe experience during this transition period can help with the
                                            anxiety. Here are some tips- approach them from front where they can see us,
                                            allow them to smell you before wake them up with a gentle touch, use
                                            flashlights to gain attention in the dark if you are out and want them to
                                            come to you, and ask kids to not startle a dog by waking them up.</p>

                                            has set minimal standards for growth, adult and lactating dog. In the
                                            absence of that, the commercial food marketed as senior dog food may include
                                            what the manufacturer has deemed important to be in senior dog food. It
                                            doesnâ€™t mean that all food marketed as senior dog food is not good, but you
                                            may want to choose and pick diet that may address the issues in your dog.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="medium-400">Some senior dog foods are lower in calories, as the senior
                                            dog metabolism may slow down. But some senior dogs may be more inclined to
                                            loose weight and you should not be putting them on a lower calorie diet
                                            often the ones advertised as senior dog diet. Healthy senior dogs do not
                                            need restricted protein diets unless they have kidney disease but again some
                                            commercial senior dog diets may have restricted protein content. Therefore
                                            the message is, there is not one size that fits all.</p>
                                        <p class="medium-400">Thus first, get support from veterinary in decision
                                            making. And secondly ensure that you look at the ingredients and energy
                                            label on the pet food packaging.</p>
